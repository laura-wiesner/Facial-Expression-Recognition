# Facial Expression Recognition

## Project Description
This project uses deep learning techniques to classify facial expressions from images. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a diverse dataset of facial images. The aim is to achieve high accuracy in identifying various expressions, which can be applied in fields such as human-computer interaction and emotional analysis.
